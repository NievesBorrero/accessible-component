# Accessible component 🧑‍🦯🌎👩🏻‍💻

This is a React project about accessibility in web components to support the presentation of "_Accesibilidad web: Buscando el componente 360_" on the occasion of the [Sysmana 2023](https://sysmana.iesgrancapitan.org).

You can see the slides [here](https://view.genial.ly/63cc2e87b47db500117ae0dc) 🖼

### 🤔 How it works?

In the project directory, you can run `yarn start` to run the app in the development mode.
Once running, open the browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Remember that the page will reload if you make edits in code and you will also see any lint errors in the console.

### 🧪 Wanna test the code?

Running the command `yarn test` you will launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for react apps for more information.

### 🧑‍🏫 Educational Purpose

This is a project with a purely educational purpose to accompany the presentation with practical examples, the code has been intentionally simplified and some good practices have been omitted to avoid generating noise
